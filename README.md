# React JS Practice

This project was built alongside [this Learn React JS course from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44). It's a lot of fun so far!

I'm approaching it a bit differently since the course encourages using Scrimba. I prefer using VS Code and a range of npm packages to manually set up my dev environment.

The first app created in this course is a traditional Todo App. Here's a screenshot:

Colors are pulled from [morhetz/gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). It's the color scheme I use in VS Code and all over my OS UI. I'll change/improve the coloring during a future update.

For anyone curious, here's how my VS Code looks. It's using gruvbox light (hard contrast):

And here's all three monitors:
